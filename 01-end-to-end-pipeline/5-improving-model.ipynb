    "The first predictions you make with a model are generally referred to as baseline predictions. The same goes with the first evaluation metrics you get. These are generally referred to as baseline metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "From a model perspective asks:\n",
    "* Is there a better model we could use? If you've started out with a simple model, could you use a more complex one? (we saw an example of this when looking at the [Scikit-Learn machine learning map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html), ensemble methods are generally considered more complex models)\n",
