[`sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(estimator, X, y)`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html#sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator) - this takes a fitted estimator (like our `clf` model), features (`X`) and labels (`y`), it then uses the trained estimator to make predictions on `X` and compares the predictions to `y` by displaying a confusion matrix.\n",

[`sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_true, y_pred)`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html#sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions) - this takes truth labels and predicted labels and compares them by displaying a confusion matrix.\n",

    "The number of rows will depend on how many different classes there are. But there will always be three rows labell accuracy, macro avg and weighted avg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each term measures something slightly different:\n",
    "* **Precision** - Indicates the proportion of positive identifications (model predicted class `1`) which were actually correct. A model which produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Recall** - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.\n",
    "* **F1 score** - A combination of precision and recall. A perfect model achieves an F1 score of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Support** - The number of samples each metric was calculated on.\n",
    "* **Accuracy** - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0, in other words, getting the prediction right 100% of the time.\n",
    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn't take class imbalance into effect. So if you do have class imbalances (more examples of one class than another), you should pay attention to this.\n",
    "* **Weighted avg** - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. it will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "When should you use each?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be tempting to base your classification models perfomance only on accuracy. And accuracy is a good metric to report, except when you have very imbalanced classes.\n",

    "For example, let's say there were 10,000 people. And 1 of them had a disease. You're asked to build a model to predict who has it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You build the model and find your model to be 99.99% accurate. Which sounds great!\n",
    "...until you realise, all its doing is predicting no one has the disease, in other words all 10,000 predictions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you'd want to turn to metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score."
