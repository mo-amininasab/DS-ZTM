    "\n",
    "Once you've got your data ready, the next step is to choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model to find patterns in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note:\n",
    "* Sklearn refers to machine learning models and algorithms as estimators.\n",
    "* Classification problem - predicting a category (heart disease or not).\n",
    "    * Sometimes you'll see `clf` (short for classifier) used as a classification estimator instance's variable name.\n",
    "* Regression problem - predicting a number (selling price of a car).\n",
    "* Unsupervised problem - clustering (grouping unlabelled samples with other similar unlabelled samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know what kind of problem you're working with, one of the next places you should look at is the [Scikit-Learn algorithm cheatsheet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This cheatsheet gives you a bit of an insight into the algorithm you might want to use for the problem you're working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember, you don't have to explicitly know what each algorithm is doing on the inside to start using them. If you do start to apply different algorithms but they don't seem to be working, that's when you'd start to look deeper into each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out the cheatsheet and follow it for some of the problems we're working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/sklearn-ml-map.png\" width=1000/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see it's split into four main categories. Regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Each has their own different purpose but the Scikit-Learn team has designed the library so the workflows for each are relatively similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a regression problem (trying to predict a number). We'll use the [California Housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) built into Scikit-Learn's `datasets` module.\n",
    "\n",
